*ðŸ‘€ Lightweight caching layer for fast and efficient content delivery*

## Overview

**LiteCDN** is a lightweight, extensible caching system that emulates core CDN functionality. Supports TTL-based expiration, LRU eviction, and a RESTful HTTP API for cache interaction. Ideal for educational purposes, rapid prototyping, or microservice integration.

## Key Features

* **TTL-Based Expiration** â€” Automatically invalidates cache entries based on timeouts.
* **LRU Eviction Policy** â€” Removes least recently used entries when full.
* **HTTP-Aware Caching** â€” Differentiates entries by HTTP method and path.
* **RESTful API Interface** â€” Built with FastAPI for managing cache operations.
* **Simulated Origin Server** â€” Mock backend replicates real HTTP responses.
* **Test Coverage** â€” `pytest` ensures reliability and correctness.
* **Modular Design** â€” Separation of caching logic and API layers for easy extension.

## Project Structure

```bash
.
â”œâ”€â”€ app.py             # FastAPI server exposing cache API endpoints
â”œâ”€â”€ cache.py           # Core cache logic (TTL, LRU, key management)
â”œâ”€â”€ main_server.py     # Simulated backend origin server
â”œâ”€â”€ test.py            # Unit tests
â”œâ”€â”€ test.sh            # Shell script to run tests
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt   # Dependencies
â””â”€â”€ figure/            # Diagrams and visuals
```

## Setup & Installation

```bash
# Create and activate virtual environment
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate   # macOS/Linux
.\env\Scripts\activate  # Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Application

```bash
# Launch backend server
uvicorn main_server:server --port 8000

# Launch cache API server
uvicorn app:app --port 8080
```

## Running Tests

```bash
pytest test.py -v
./test.sh
```
